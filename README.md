# Bridge_function

We have a number of points given in (x,y)-coordinates and wish to calculate the distance from all points to all points - this is a task that shows up in a variety of problems across different domains.

Simply looping over all the points and calculating the distances is easy but inefficient. This program is my attempt at developing more efficient algorithms.
